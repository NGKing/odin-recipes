        <h3>Description</h3> 
            <p>
                This recipe will lead you to create the perfect cooked steak. It will be tasty, buttery, seasoned, and juicy by the time you're done. 
                Steaks are a favorite of mine to cook. It's easier than it looks as a lot of the time waiting is having it marinate in your seasonings. 
                Once it's on the pan, you should be done in no time. I'll even explain my secret to a perfect steak in the recipe below.
