I am creating a basic website that, when visited, starts at a home page (index.html) and will show links to recipes. Those links will open up in other pages. I will need to demonstrate my skills in using commands like ordered and unordered lists, writing proper commit messages, and using relative links. I will likely have to use more skills but these are the initial ones that will lead me to success in making this page.
